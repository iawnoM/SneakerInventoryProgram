Inventory Program for Sneakers

This is an application built primarily in JavaFX to display and keep track of sneaker inventory. The GUI contains information about the shoes such as SKU number, brand, size, and several other attributes. The data is stored in a MySQL database and is updated in real time as the user can add, edit, and delete entries. 

Currently, the database is only connected to my personal local machine, but the user ip and passowrd can be changed as needed to configure with local machine.
